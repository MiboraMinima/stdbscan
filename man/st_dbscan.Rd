\usage{
st_dbscan(x, y, t, eps_spatial, eps_temporal, min_pts)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of x-coordinates (spatial).}

\item{y}{Numeric vector of y-coordinates (spatial).}

\item{t}{Numeric vector of time values.}

\item{eps_spatial}{Numeric. The spatial radius threshold. Points closer than
this in space may belong to the same cluster.}

\item{eps_temporal}{Numeric. The temporal threshold. Points closer than this
in time may belong to the same cluster.}

\item{min_pts}{Integer. Minimum number of points required to form a core
point (standard DBSCAN parameter).}
}
\value{
An integer vector of length \code{length(x)} with cluster assignments:
\itemize{
\item{0 — not visited / unassigned (should not occur in final output)}
\item{-1 — noise point}
\item{>0 — cluster ID}
}
}
\description{
Perform \strong{ST-DBSCAN} clustering on points with spatial and temporal
coordinates. This algorithm identifies clusters of points that are close both
in space and time.
}
\details{
ST-DBSCAN extends classical DBSCAN by incorporating a temporal constraint.
Two points are considered neighbors if they are within \code{eps_spatial} in
space \strong{and} within \code{eps_temporal} in time. Clusters are expanded from
core points recursively following the DBSCAN algorithm.

This function is implemented in C++ via Rcpp for speed.

\examples{
x <- c(0, 0.1, -0.1, 5, 5.1)
y <- c(0, 0.1, -0.1, 5, 5.1)
t <- c(0, 1, 2, 0, 1)

st_dbscan(x, y, t, eps_spatial = 0.3, eps_temporal = 2, min_pts = 2)
